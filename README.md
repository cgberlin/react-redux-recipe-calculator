# Recipe Calculcator
## A web app to help find recipes.
At the current stage of development the app is able to retrieve recipes
either randomly or containing specified ingredients.
Please read below for more info.

## Summary
This recipe app will allow a user to retrieve recipes either randomly or
by submitting any ingredients that they may want to use or add. 
It is possible for me to expand this to allow searching by nutritional 
or other values.

## Technology used
I built Text Bug using Node.js and express on the backend.
For the recipe retrieval I used the spoontacular API. 
The front end is built using React and Redux with Material-UI for the
styling of the components.
